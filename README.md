The repo contains the code to run the fast MATLAB-based BM3D software
for image denoising, which I called GBM3D. See reference at the bottom for details.
To see how to run the code, just run the "demoDenoise.m" file in MATLAB. You will
need a GPU and parallel computing toolbox to realize the full speed up benefits.
